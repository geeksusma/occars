# Vehicle Bookings for OC's Cars

Our Company is a small one which is becoming so popular after publishing some adverts on TV. The business is runned up by and old retired race car driver called Ortega Cano, who needs a solution now the booking requests are growing.

The business has a small flote of vehicles, some big bikes, small vans (they can be adapted for camping) and cars (they can be small, medium or big) The cost per day it depends on the vehicle and the season (Spring and Summer are considered the most expensive seasons so the price is increased a 15% per day)

Customers can book only a vehicle at a time (because, basically, he can't drive two vehicles at same time) but they can change his vehicle along the journey. The price of the journey is calculated once the journey is over.

Customers must have a license-id, and they must have more than two years driving.

Obviously, a vehicle can't be booked if it is already booked for the same period of time, or it can't be booked if it is already in a journey.

We provide to our customers the vehicles with their tank full, if they don't return the vehicle in same conditions, a penalty is included as part of the final price (it depends on how big is the tank for the vehicle, 30$ for bikes, 80$ for vans, and 40$, 50$, 60$ for S, M and XL cars).

So, please provide to Ortega Cano a nice solution to run his job, otherwise he will back to the road again.
